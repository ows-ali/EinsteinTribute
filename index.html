      <p id="short-intro">
        Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Germany, the first child of a
        bourgeois Jewish couple. The young Albert displayed an early interest in
        science, but he was unhappy with the principles of obedience and
        conformity that governed his Catholic elementary school.

          <li>
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who
            developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern
            physics.
          </li>
          <li>
            He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy
            equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most
            famous equation".
          </li>
          <li>
            He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
            theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of
            the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of
            quantum theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            He lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, except for one year
            in Prague, and he received his academic diploma from the Swiss
            federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische
            Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich in 1900. He taught theoretical physics
            there between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150
            non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality
            have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".
